# JetJet Theme
This package comes with three themes: Original, Alternate, and Light.
This theme will work for VS Code versions 1.8.0 and greater.


# Workbench Customization

If you would like to cutomize the workbench colors to get a more complimentary look, you can add the `workbench.colorCustomizations` setting in your `settings.json`. Note that this works for version 1.12 and greater.
For example,
```json
"workbench.colorCustomizations":{
    "tab.activeBackground": "#012A4B",
    "activityBar.background": "#012A4B",
    "statusBar.background": "#012A4B",
    "activityBarBadge.background": "#FFD600",
    "activityBarBadge.foreground": "#1A1D21",
    "editorGroup.background": "#1A1D21",
    "sideBar.background": "#1A1D21"
}
```
Enjoy!
